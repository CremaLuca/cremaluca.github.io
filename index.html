                After a research about replicated and distributed network this library has been produced. We implemented it using SMSs but interfaces are suitable for an internet based network too. Two kind of network has been implemented: replicated and distributed
                (Kademlia). Both kinds allow setting a resource, getting it and removing it. </p>

                As part of a university course we developed an application based on SMSs to make your phone ring by sending it a code and a password. Very useful to find your phone when you forgot to turn connection on. </p>

                Android library to send and receive SMS messages quickly. Encodes a hidden character in messages in order to hide them from the rest of the applications. Looks small but it's been a difficult way to have 20 people agree on the same structure. </p>

                The idea started as a joke, a place where swimmers and their friends could bet on the competitions results; then it became the first webapp I had ever developed. It also gives possibility to see athlete statistics over time.
                <br />I'll come back and finish it properly one day. </p>

                The idea came from a friend of mine: a game where you have to make a number reach 0 by using operations in the right order. It has been a hard first approach to project management for a team of three and the last approach to games developement so far.

                My first approach to game developement and to Unity3D. A gamed that gained its popularity as quick as it lost it, a clicker based on swimming where you had to click faster than AI to win competitions. It became more interesting when results were compared
                using Google Play Services leaderboards. </p>

                Website similar to <a href='https://subito.it'>subito.it</a> where users can sell their used books either by choosing an existing one or adding a new one. Everybody can then see who is selling what book and get in touch with the seller.
