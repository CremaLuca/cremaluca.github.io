                <p> During our internship in University of Pauda, together with Prof. Enoch Peserico we developed a software

                    Docker containers. </p>

                <p> After a research about replicated and distributed network this library has been produced. We implemented
                    it using SMSs but interfaces are suitable for an internet based network too. Two kind of network has been
                    implemented: replicated and distributed (Kademlia). Both kinds allow setting a resource, getting it and
                    removing it. </p>

                <p> The idea came from a friend of mine: a game where you have to make a number reach 0 by using operations
                    in the right order. It has been a hard first approach to project management for a team of three and the
                    last approach to games developement so far. </p>

                    lost it, a clicker based on swimming where you had to click faster than AI to win competitions. It became
                    more interesting when results were compared using Google Play Services leaderboards. </p>
